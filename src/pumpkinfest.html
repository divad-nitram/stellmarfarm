                            Farmfest</a> as Pumpkinfest. Come and celebrate our 20th anniversary of Pumpkinfest. See
                        giant pumpkins and visit the craft shed at Stellmar Farm, which features: pumpkins, squash,
                        gourds, fall decorations, flower arrangements, decorative corn, wreaths, fall crafts, gourd art,
                        preserves, honey, and tasty pumpkin bread. Try your luck at guessing the weight of the giant
                        pumpkin to win a gift basket. Perhaps even learn the secret behind growing giant pumpkins! Try
                        out our full line of homemade soaps, body butters, and lotions: many products contain our own
                        beeswax and honey! For an additional fee of $5 per person or $20 per family of 4 or more, take a
                        tour through our haunted corn maze. Try your hand at the games around the farm. And finally
                        bring your appetite for our hot dog lunch special. Washrooms available. Ongoing: Farmfest
                        participants can guess the weight of a giant pumpkin, walk the corn maze ($), vote for the best
